# Project Helios: Developing a System to Analyze High-Intensity Solar Flare Events

Solar flares are an interesting phenomenon. They are classified as a space weather event and are essentially a sudden burst of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun. Solar flares typically occur due to the Sun’s atmosphere excitation above magnetically active regions of the Sun. The observed light of solar flares results from the rapid conversion and release of energy stored in the electrical currents and magnetic field of the Sun’s outer atmosphere, the corona, and through a series of processes, photons and various particles are accelerated out of the corona, creating the flare and solar winds. This surge of particles and radiation into outer space can interfere with the environment on Earth; the impact includes disruptions in satellite communications, power grids, and increased radiation levels in Earth’s upper atmosphere.

Unfortunately, due to the limited understanding of the formation of magnetically active solar regions, we do not have a complete grasp of solar flares and their properties. However, we can observe certain patterns and characteristics of solar flares thanks to data from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI).
